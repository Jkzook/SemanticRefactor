## Description

The motivation to build this project was to make the code more accessible to those viewing the website and make the website itself more accessible and easy to use. This not only makes the website more  approachable and  easy to navigate in  general, but also for those with disabilities. This  project helped with learning about HTML, CSS, formatting, etc. 

## Installation

The project was utilized and made in  VS code. First, the starter code had to be cloned to the local machine. Next the code was opened in VS code.  After every significant change, a commit was made and then that commit and the changes were pushed to the main repository in GitHub where they could then  be viewed with descripions. Changes were made in both HTML and to the CSS style sheet (i.e. consolidation). After the code was made to help the website be more accessible and all changes were pushed, the website was deployed and went live.

## Usage

Instructions and examples for use are pretty simple. The website was made more accessible and people will now be able to navigate said website to find the informaion that they need.
